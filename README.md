# CH IPS

The International Patient Summary (IPS) document is an electronic health record extract containing essential healthcare information about a subject of care. As specified in EN 17269 and ISO/DIS 27269, it is designed for supporting the use case scenario for ‘unplanned, cross border care’, but it is not limited to it. See additional info [here](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/).
