The following use cases serve to illustrate possible scenarios for the use of the International Patient Summary document. The cases are designed to illustrate the representation of the document.

### Use case 1
Mrs. [Monika Wegmüller](Patient-MonikaWegmueller.html), born on 15 May 1943, comes to the emergency room on 26 April 2024 with sudden onset of malaise, dizziness and breathing difficulties. She is cared for by a team of medical and nursing staff. The doctor in charge at the hospital, Dr. Martina Meier, retrieves Mrs. Wegmüller's [**most recent IPS document (11 January 2024)**](Bundle-UC1-SwissIpsDocument1.html), which the [family doctor](PractitionerRole-FamilienHausarztAtHausarzt.html) prepared on 11 January 2024. Dr. Meier sees documented in it that Mrs. Wegmüller suffers from [diabetes](Condition-DiabetesMellitus.html) and [high blood pressure](Condition-HighBloodPressure.html) and therefore takes [metformin](MedicationStatement-MedStatMetformin.html) and [candesartan](MedicationStatement-MedStatCandesartan.html), and that she also has [coronary heart disease](Condition-CoronaryHeartDisease.html), which is why Mrs. Wegmüller received a [stent](Procedure-StentPlacement.html) two years ago. Mrs. Wegmüller's allergies and intolerances have not yet been asked about by her family doctor.
  

Based on this preliminary information, Dr. Meier suspects a heart attack as the reason for her discomfort and breathing difficulties, which is confirmed by the ECG and laboratory tests. Mrs. Wegmüller is taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where it is revealed that a coronary vessel is almost blocked and she needs another stent. Because Dr. Meier was so well informed, she was able to act quickly and Mrs. Wegmüller quickly improved. She is admitted to the cardiac monitoring ward (cardio-IMC) for monitoring.     

[Dr. Meier](PractitionerRole-869a4dd9-3a4a-4838-ad1e-42453d341147.html) continues to look after her there and at the end of her hospital stay, a [**new IPS document (May 3, 2024)**](Bundle-UC1-SwissIpsDocument2.html) is created for Mrs. Wegmüller with the latest and additional information.



Mrs. Wegmüller has [no known allergies](AllergyIntolerance-NoKnownAllergy.html).
